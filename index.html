            <p>Pepper is my eleven year old american short hair tabby cat. We got her when she was just a few weeks old 11 years ago in puyallup.
                Pepper was rescued from a dumpster where she was found all alone. Weve kept pepper as weve moved from 3 different houses and had 3 other pets. She's the kind of cat who gets really calm and just sleeps when she's given catnip.
                Her favorite toy is a lazer pointer, she goes crazy running around and trying to climb walls. She likes yogurt, sometimes to lick chips, and loves turkey. She's kind of a weird cat, but she gives so many reasons to love her.
