                <h1>HERE'S HER ORIGIN STORY</h1>
                <p>We got pepper 11 years ago. Pepper was given to us by a family member who does animal rescue. She was found in a dumpster outside of a convenience store with matted fur, fleas, constipation, and no family.
                    We took her in and were planning only to nurse her back to health, along with 11 other strays, a baby squirrel, and our own pet named salt.<br><br>

                    My mom's sister was the animal rescuer, and my mom was the one who would offer to nurse them until they found a permanent home. It ranged from squirrles, to raccoons, to cats, to just about anything. As kids,
                    me and my four brothers, would get to learn about feeding, nursing, and taking care of these tiny adorable ceatures. Pepper had 11 siblings, but out of all of them, we kept her. She had a huge head, and really small body.
                    When she walked around, or rather, tried to walk, her head would bob and her feet were unsteady.<br><br>

                    After around 3 months of taking care of these babies, almost all of them had found homes. The ones that remained were given to my aunt again and she would take care of them for the rest of the necessary time. Well.. all of them besides pepper.
                    She grew on us as time went on and when it was time to let her go, we couldn't.<br><br>
